# Mooncake Github Repository

The Mooncake source code is currently private and unverified on BSC scan. This is because we are currently in the midst of a licensing deal with a 3rd party. We plan to release and verify the token contract shortly after the deal is complete. The Mooncake Oven contract will remain private until it has been audited.

If you wish to view the code before it's released, you may contact https://t.me/faithistheway or https://t.me/derpamine via Telegram.
